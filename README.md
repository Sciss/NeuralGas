# NeuralGas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sciss/NeuralGas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sciss/NeuralGas)

## statement

This project was originally forked from [github.com/gittar/demogng](https://github.com/gittar/demogng).
It was a demonstration of various topological learning algorithms,
most prominently the Growing Neural Gas (Fritzke). It has since been adapted to provide a library for
the neural gas algorithms.
